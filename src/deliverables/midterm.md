# Midterm deliverables and activities

<!-- toc -->

## 1. Midterm report

The midterm report should provide the skeleton of the final report: a preliminary table of content of the final report with, for each section, a text drafted or a text indicating the intended content of that particular section.

A template for the report will be provided to obtain uniformity in the structure of all synthesis reports.
<!-- TODO: where is this template actually?-->




## 2. Midterm presentation

Each project team gives a midterm presentation including:

* project at hand summarised
* status and progress of the project: preliminary results
* amendments to the Project Initiation Document, including motivation
    of these amendments, consequences, etc. (if necessary)

Also include your presentation the process/management of the project:

* how your project is organised (who is responsible for what, time
    management, communication, how is the supervision organised, risk
    management/ mitigation)
* involvement of the company
* what runs well, what needs to be improved
* planning until the final report deadline

The presentation is 15min, followed by questions from the peer-review team and questions/comments from the supervisors.
The audience consists of all GEO1101 students, the supervisors, and possibly the clients.

``` admonish info
**Recommendation:** Prepare at this stage a written summary of the
results of your project. This helps you to conduct your oral
presentation and eases the completion of the final report.
