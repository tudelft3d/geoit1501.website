# Final deliverables


<!-- toc -->

## 1. Final report/code/docs

The final deliverables can be of several forms, and will be determined in consultation with your TU Delft supervisors and the client. 

We always expect a technical report of some form, but this is not the only output that is assessed.
Examples of outputs that can be considered:

1. a prototype software that the client will be able to use
1. documentation and/or tutorial about the prototype software.
1. a dataset that the client will be able to use in the future
1. a website that the client wanted to have built

In the report, please include the [task distribution table](../grading/task_distribution.md).

See [example reports from previous years](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/gm/msc-geomatics/programme/synthesis-project/).


```{note}
No need to copy the code in the report, put it on GitHub and give a URL in the report.

After green light of your TU Delft supervisors, the final report should also be uploaded to the [TU Delft repository](https://repository.tudelft.nl) ([how to do that](https://tudelft-lib-research.gitbook.io/tu-delft-library-user-instructions/thesis/how-to-upload-your-thesis)).

## 2. Final technical presentation 

This presentation will focus on the **technical aspects** of the research performed.
The audience is your fellow students and the staff of Geomatics.
The idea is that you present and discuss the engineering details of the project, and you can assume that the audience is knowledgeable and thus there is no need to simplify the talk.

- 20min presentation
- 5min reflection/question from the [peer-review team](./peer-review.md)
- 5min reflection/question from the supervisors
- 5min general discussion

Feedback will be provided on the content of the research as well as on the presentation.


## 3. Final outreach presentation (during the Geomatics day)

This is the presentation for a general audience, and thus should be accessible and understandable by laypersons (who work in the field of Geomatics)

- 15min presentation
- 5min question from the audience.
