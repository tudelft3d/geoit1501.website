# Grading

Your final grade is compiled from:

1. a group grade for the project final report/deliverables;
1. an individual performance, 
1. an individual reflection, which is based on a written reflection at the midterm and a 10min interview at the end. The individual reflection on the final report can influence positively or negatively for 0.5 grade point (maximum) the grade on the final report. 

In order to pass the course, students have to:

<!-- TODO -->
1. attend and take part in the group's midterm presentation and final presentations (both of them),
2. show a sufficient level of cooperation and communication with students, supervisor(s) and geo-information professionals (see [Rubric individual work](./work.md)), 
3. submit a sufficient reflection on the quality of the (midterm) project result(s), on the feasibility to implement the project result(s) in practice, and on their own performance in the project, obtain a pass for their individual project strategy proposal (see XXXXXX), and
4. show to have performed a sufficient amount of tasks (either quantitative or qualitative) in the project (see [Task distribution](./task_distribution.md)).

To pass the course, a group mark and an individual mark of at least a 5.75 is required. Students that fail the course have to do a repair assignment for a maximum grade of a 6.0 for the course.
If a student fails, then the student has to take the course in another academic year again.

## Oral assessment with supervisors

Each student will have to attend an individual oral assessment with their TUDelft supervisors at the end.
This is done to ensure that all members of the teams work equally, to evaluate performance of each student, and that of the group.

```admonish info
This meeting will be planned by the supervisors, and there is nothing specific to prepare.
```


## Three rubrics are used

1. [Rubric group report](./report.md)
1. [Rubric individual work](./work.md)
1. [Rubric reflection](./reflection.md)
