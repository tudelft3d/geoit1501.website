Your final grade is based on:

1. a **group grade** for the project final report and/or the deliverables;
1. an **individual performance**, which includes an individual reflection (based on a written reflection at the midterm and a 10-minute personal interview at the end, see below). The individual reflection on the final report can influence positively or negatively for 0.5 grade point (maximum) the grade on the final report. If the different interviews highlight that a student did not contribute to the group's work, he/she can also fail the course.

In order to pass the course, students have to:

1. attend and take part in the group's midterm presentation and final presentations (both of them),
2. show a sufficient level of cooperation and communication with students, supervisor(s) and geo-information professionals (see [Rubric individual work](./work.md)), 
3. submit a sufficient reflection on the quality of the (midterm) project result(s), on the feasibility to implement the project result(s) in practice, and on their own performance in the project, and
4. show to have performed a sufficient amount of tasks (either quantitative or qualitative) in the project (see [Task distribution](./task_distribution.md)).

To pass the course, at least a 5.75 is required. 
Students that fail the course have to do a repair assignment for a maximum grade of a 6.0 for the course.
If a student fails the repair, then they have to take the course in the following academic year again.


## Oral assessment with supervisors

Each student will have to attend an individual oral assessment with their TUDelft supervisors at the end.
This is done to ensure that all members of the teams work equally, to evaluate performance of each student, and that of the group.

```{note} 
This meeting will be scheduled by the supervisors, and there is nothing specific to prepare.
```

## Three rubrics are used

1. [Rubric group report](./report.md)
1. [Rubric individual work](./work.md)
1. [Rubric reflection](./reflection.md)
